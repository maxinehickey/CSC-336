        My mom is a private chef and has worked for many old-money ridiculously rich people in Massachusetts. Her very first job was for Tom Kershaw at the end of the production of Cheers!<br>
        <br>
         She is completely self-taught because she had no money to go to culinary school. Not gonna lie my mom is a girlboss because she's been a chef in Boston, Los Angeles, and Sydney. Her hopes and dreams were crushed once she had children and now uses her skills to make me and my sister food whenever we visit. I call my mom every day asking the same question "What should I make for dinner tonight?"<br>
      I guess my mom passed some of her culinary talents to me as I am a reformed child baking prodigy (my specialty was pastries)
